					<h3>1. GLP Conditions</h3>
					<p>GLP is a global community (general public and inside organisations) of responsible individuals who believe the globe is in desperate need of greater, more mature and authentic leadership. Users and contributors to this platform are honoured to be involved and believe they are always learning from one another, contributing in a positive manner and striving to make the world a better place for future generations.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It’s a magnet / growing library for all things leadership – attracting all leadership content, conversation and inspiration – available on your phone, tablet and laptop.</li>
						<li>It’s an attraction for all leaders and leadership experts, not only to make use of, learn, grow and be inspired by, but in selected cases to contribute to the body of leadership content as an invited Global Contributor.</li>
						<li>Global Contributors inside organisations may post internally (inside their organisation) or globally (outside their organisation to all users globally).</li>
						<li>It’s a productive communication platform for leaders of organisations and society at large. We recognise that effective communication, real time, is one of the greatest challenges of leadership.</li>
						<li>It’s a web based digital leadership platform for society, organisations and individuals.</li>
						<li>It’s a web based digital platform for all things leadership.</li>
						<li>It’s a platform that allows for general public globally to download the App, make use of, comment and post actions inside their Personal Leadership Development Plan.</li>
						<li>Users may follow and unfollow Global Contributors, thereby receiving notifications of their posts.</li>
						<li>Ordinary Users globally are known as I-LEAD contributors and are encouraged to share under the I-LEAD space: 1) Examples of how “I lead inside my environment, where I stand”, to start leading as part of the solution. 2) I-Leaders are encouraged to share good leadership examples around them – their boss; subordinates; employees; school teacher; children; and so on. 3) They are also encouraged to share their views on great leadership. They are our eyes and ears on the ground in sharing real life examples of great, authentic leadership.</li>
						<li>It’s a platform for organisations to empower employees with leadership content, personal development and clearer, real time, productive communication from Top Leaders.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You might not like everything you see, read, listen to or watch on this platform. If you think content is inappropriate – based on the terms of this agreement - use the feedback function to report it for review by our GLP team. They carefully review content on a day to day basis to determine whether there’s a violation of our Community Guidelines.</p>
					<p>Again, this is a global community of responsible individuals where the primary focus is leadership content, empowerment, the successful leading of organisations across the globe, showcasing great leadership, as well as successful leadership of self. The following is not allowed:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
								<b>Nudity or sexual content:</b> Pornography or sexually explicit content is not acceptable. If this describes your contribution in any way, even if it's a video of yourself, don't share it on GLP. Sexually explicit content like pornography is not allowed. Videos containing fetish content will be removed. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes will not be shown on GLP.
						</li>
						<li>
								<b>Hateful content:</b> We do not accept content that intends to incite violence or encourage dangerous or illegal activities that have an inherent risk of serious physical harm or death. All content that incites others to commit acts of violence is strictly prohibited on GLP. If your contribution in any way asks others to commit an act of violence or threatens people with serious acts of violence, it will be removed from the platform.
						</li>
						<li>
								<b>Privacy:</b> If someone has posted your personal information or posted your content without your consent, you can request removal of this content. However, kindly request the removal of the content from the uploader directly first and if that doesn’t work out contact us.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Threats:</b> Things like predatory behaviour, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal information, attempting to destroy someone’s reputation and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are not acceptable. Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from GLP.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Vulgar Language:</b> We don’t subscribe to this. Use of sexually explicit language or excessive profanity in your posts or associated metadata may lead to it being deleted without notification.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Despite the above, you understand and acknowledge that in using the platform, the odd slip up may occur and you therefore stand the risk of being exposed to Content that is factually inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable to you. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against GLP with respect to any such Content.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter2">
					<h3>2. Your personal relationship with GLP</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Your use of the GLP App (the "App") and any GLP products, channels, software, data feeds and services, is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and GLP. "GLP" means Global Leadership Platform (a service by ThinkLead Pty Ltd), whose principal place of business is based at 1st Floor, Eco-Court, 340 Witch-Hazel Avenue, Centurion, South Africa.</li>
						<li>The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and GLP in relation to your use of the Service. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.</li>
						<li>The Terms apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service. "Content" includes the text, articles, podcasts, audios, videos, ebooks, graphics, photos, sounds, music, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through or contribute to the Service.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter3">
					<h3>3. Accepting the Terms</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>In order to use the Service, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Service if you do not accept the Terms.</li>
						<li>You can accept the Terms by simply using the Service. You understand and agree that GLP will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</li>
						<li>You may not use the Service and may not accept the Terms if:
							<ol type="a">
								<li>you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with GLP, or</li>
								<li>you are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using the Service under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use the Service.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter4">
					<h3>4. Changes to the Terms</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>GLP reserves the right to make changes on the Terms from time to time, for example to address changes to the law or regulatory changes or changes to functionality offered through the Service. Therefore you are required to look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") will be made available within the Service. If you do not agree to the Modified Terms you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the date the Modified Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of the Modified Terms.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter5">
					<h3>5. GLP Accounts</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>In order to access some features of the App or other elements of the Service, you will have to create a GLP account. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. It is important that you must keep your GLP account password secure and confidential.</li>
						<li>You must notify GLP immediately of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your GLP account as soon as you become aware of such breach or unauthorised use.</li>
						<li>You agree that you will be solely responsible (to GLP, and to others) for all activity that occurs under your GLP account.</li>
						<li>GLP hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:
							<ol type="1">
								<li>you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the App or the Service, including but not limited to any Content, in any medium without GLP 's prior written authorisation, unless GLP makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service;</li>
								<li>you agree not to alter or modify any part of the App or any of the Service;</li>
								<li>you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content accessible via the Service;</li>
								<li>you agree not to collect or harvest any personal data of any user of the App or any Service (and agree that this shall be deemed to include GLP account names);</li>
								<li>you agree not to use the App or the Services (including the comments and email features in the App) for the solicitation of business in the course of trade or in connection with a commercial enterprise;</li>
								<li>you agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the App with respect to their Content;</li>
								<li>you shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of GLP  or the respective licensors of the Content.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>GLP is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service which GLP provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</li>
						<li>As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that GLP  may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at GLP 's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform GLP  when you stop using the Service.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter6">
					<h3>6. Links from GLP</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The Service may include hyperlinks to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by GLP. GLP has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party Apps.</li>
						<li>You acknowledge and agree that GLP is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such web sites or resources.</li>
						<li>You acknowledge and agree that GLP is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.</li>
						<li>GLP encourages you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other App that you visit.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter7">
					<h3>7. Ending your relationship with GLP</h3>
					<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or GLP as set out below.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you want to terminate your legal agreement with GLP, you may do so by (a) notifying GLP  at any time and (b) closing your GLP  account. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to GLP's address info@leadershipplatform.com.</li>
						<li>GLP  may at any time terminate its legal agreement with you if:
							<ol>
								<li>you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or </li>
								<li>GLP  is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Service to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>GLP  may terminate its legal agreement with you if:
							<ol>
								<li>GLP is transitioning to no longer providing the Service to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service; or</li>

							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and GLP have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter8">
					<h3>8. Exclusion of Warranties</h3>

							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="chapter10">
					<h3>10. General Legal Terms</h3>

						<li>You agree that GLP may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service.</li>
						<li>You agree that if GLP does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which GLP has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of GLP's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to GLP.</li>
						<li>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</li>

				</div>
				<div id="chapter11">
